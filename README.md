# ADXL345_WE
Arduino Library for the ADXL345 accelerometer

I have tried to create a library for the ADXL345 which is easy to use for people who don't want to deal with all the registers. Therefore I have added lots example sketches which will enable you to deal even with the more complex features such as the FIFO modes. 

I will soon publish a detailed tutorial on my website "https://wolles-elektronikkiste.de". It will be available in German language first and a few weeks later also in English language.
